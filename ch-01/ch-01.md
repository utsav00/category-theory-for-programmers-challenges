# 1.4 Challenges

1. Implement, as best as you can, the identity function in your fa-
vorite language (or the second favorite, if your favorite language
happens to be Haskell).

```python
def identity(x):
    return x
```

2. Implement the composition function in your favorite language. It
takes two functions as arguments and returns a function that is
their composition.

```python
def compose(f, g):
    return lambda x: g(f(x))
```

3. Write a program that tries to test that your composition function
respects identity.

```python
assert compose(lambda x: x + 3, identity)(1) == 4
assert compose(identity, lambda x: x + 3)(1) == 4
```

4. Is the world-wide web a category in any sense? Are links mor-phisms?  
Yes. Objects are then webpages and links are composable.

5. Is Facebook a category, with people as objects and friendships as
morphisms?  
No beacuse morphisms are not composable i.e. A->B and B->C does not imply A->C here

6. When is a directed graph a category?  
a. self-loop  
b. transitive traversal i.e. A->B->C implies A->c link as well
